# Github Pagination

It is a basic website created using HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Bootstrap . In this project I have designed and developed a basic github repositary page listing page similar to the og github repo listing page.
Im getting repo data from github api and displaying it.

## Features

1. Pagination - we are storing 10 repos per page , and their will be almost 10 pages in total , I'm creating repo list dynamically as the repos are getting updated in github account it will automatically getts updated. 
2. Search bar - I've added search bar to search repos by their name.


## Assumptions 

Actually I'm fetching only the most used language within a repo , so im just duplicating those repo languages.
and this is my friends repo ..
